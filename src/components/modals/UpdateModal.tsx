        I have received a DMCA takedown message from the New York Times, via github, for the Git repository on which this is based.  I've made some changes (e.g., to the location of the Keyboard) based on the details in the letter but whether this will convince them is anyone's guess.  If this suddenly vanishes you will know why.

        As many of you have noticed, Doctor Whordle has switched from 5-letter to 6-letter words.  This is basically because it had worked through my list of 5 letter words.  The new 6-letter word list should last 
        until around May/June next year.  Then I'll need to think of something else.

        My apologies for the way this was sprung on many of you.  Foolishly, I had assumed it would be obvious what had happened but, in retrospect, I should have given some advance warning.  It didn't 
        help that my database of regular 6-letter words wasn't as extensive as would have been ideal (hopefully it is better now) and there are some bugs with the new "Random Word" mode that I'm working on.

        Speaking of which, the Random Word mode uses the old 5-letter word list.  It won't track stats like the 6-letter Word of the Day, but each time you complete a 5-letter whordle you should be 
        able to instantly generate another.  This is new functionality so there may be some bugs I've not noticed yet.
